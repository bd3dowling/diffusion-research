\section{Results}

\paragraph{Tips for the Results section.} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item If your main findings are of a theoretical nature, you may prefer to describe any new/original statistical procedures or models in the Results section.
    \item Describe your findings concisely and precisely using scientific language. 
    \item Include sound interpretations and explanations wherever possible to demonstrate your original and clear statistical thought process. 
    \item Use figures and tables to support your main arguments, which should include a caption describing, e.g., what is shown on the $x-$ and $y$-axis or in the rows and columns. Summarise the main finding or headline numbers in the main text, including references to Figures and Tables as needed. Do not report all numbers shown in a figure or table.
    \item Include references to previous work as needed. 
    \item Structure your Results section into numbered Subsections and Subsubsections as needed, and feel free to reference these throughout.
    \item Aim for approximately 5-15 pages, similar in style to a general science or statistics research paper.
