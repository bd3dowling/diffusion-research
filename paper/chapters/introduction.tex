\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{Tips for the Introduction.} This is where you describe the topic and the research objectives of your project. 

You should attempt to set your work in the context of other work previously done in the field. Convey the background of your research referencing earlier work as appropriate. Define core terms. Include background and context, and focus as appropriate on the wider statistical context. Aim to demonstrate that you can confidently describe your project within a broader context of statistical research, as well as scientific research, that goes well beyond the more narrow topic of your project.


The introduction needs to demonstrate that you are aware of what you are doing, and how it relates to other work that should be properly referenced. 

Clearly point out your main contributions at the end of the introduction, and provide an overview how the rest of your report is structured and links together. 

Aim for approximately 1.5-3 pages, similar in style to a general science or statistics research paper.\footnote{Tip: If you choose to use footnotes, do so sparingly.}.
