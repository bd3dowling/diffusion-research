\paragraph{Tips for the Endmatter section.} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Include a data availability statement. Examiners must be able to reproduce your analyses on all the data investigated as would be the case during peer review of a research paper.
    \item Include a reproducibility statement, including the URL under which your code can be found. Except in very rare circumstances, your code should be freely and publicly available under a \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en}{CC-BY-4.0} license. Examiners must be able to see your code, and they must be able to run your code.
\end{itemize}
