\paragraph{Tips for the Discussion section.} 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Begin your Discussion with a summary and the main findings of your research in 2-5 sentences.
    \item Describe the implications of your main findings in the context of existing work concisely and precisely using scientific language. 
    \item Describe the limitations in your statistical methods and your main findings. Be honest about the limitations in your approach, and substantiate what could have been done differently as needed. Explain if your main findings are robust or sensitive to these limitations.
    \item Avoid Subsections and Subsubsections in the Discussion.
    \item In the last paragraph, conclude your report with a pitch using plain language that summarises the key implications of your research in the context of previous work. Write this last paragraph for the Imperial Press Office or journalists as audience.
    \item Aim for approximately 1-3 pages, similar in style to a general science or statistics research paper.
\end{itemize}
